## 📚 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my web development coursework to demonstrate full-stack development skills using Next.js and MongoDB. The application provides a complete user management system with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through a modern, responsive interface.

### 🎓 Learning Objectives Achieved

- ✅ Implemented RESTful API endpoints using Next.js App Router
- ✅ Connected a MongoDB database using Mongoose ODM
- ✅ Created a responsive UI with shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling and form validation
- ✅ Developed modular React components with proper state management
- ✅ Applied TypeScript for type safety throughout the application

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **React 18** - Server Components & Client Components
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui** - Modern component library
- **Sonner** - Toast notifications

### Backend
- **Next.js API Routes** - Serverless API endpoints
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database
- **Mongoose ODM** - MongoDB object modeling

### Development Tools
- **VS Code** - Code editor
- **Git & GitHub** - Version control
- **MongoDB Compass** - Database GUI

## 📋 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Request Body | Response |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| `GET` | `/api/user` | Fetch all users | - | `{ success: boolean, users: User[] }` |
| `POST` | `/api/user` | Create a new user | `{ username, email, phone, address }` | `{ success: boolean, user: User }` |
| `GET` | `/api/user/[id]` | Fetch a specific user | - | `{ success: boolean, user: User }` |
| `PUT` | `/api/user/[id]` | Update a specific user | `{ username, email, phone, address }` | `{ success: boolean, user: User }` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/user/[id]` | Delete a specific user | - | `{ success: boolean, message: string }` |

## 💻 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- MongoDB installed locally or MongoDB Atlas account
- Git installed



## 🧠 Challenges & Learning Outcomes

### 1. **MongoDB Integration** 🗄️
**Challenge**: Understanding asynchronous database operations and connection management.

**Solution**: Implemented a singleton connection pattern to avoid multiple connections.

**Learning**: Gained deep understanding of NoSQL databases and ODM patterns.

### 2. **TypeScript Implementation** 📝
**Challenge**: Ensuring proper typing throughout the application, especially with Mongoose models.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive interfaces and proper type definitions.

**Learning**: Improved code quality and caught errors during development.

### 3. **Next.js App Router** 🛣️
**Challenge**: Adapting to the new App Router paradigm and async params in Next.js 15.

**Solution**: Updated API routes to handle async params properly.

**Learning**: Mastered modern Next.js patterns and server-side rendering.

### 4. **State Management** 🔄
**Challenge**: Managing complex form state and synchronizing with server data.

**Solution**: Implemented proper state lifting and custom hooks.

**Learning**: Better understanding of React state patterns and data flow.

### 5. **Error Handling** ⚠️
**Challenge**: Implementing comprehensive error handling across frontend and backend.

**Solution**: Created consistent error responses and user-friendly error messages.

**Learning**: Importance of robust error handling in production applications.
